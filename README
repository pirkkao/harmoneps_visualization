This is a python program meant to visualize FA-files
from HarmonEPS runs.

The program builds on top of "epygram"-tool and uses
it to generate subplots of:
 1) forecast fields at given level+forecast range
 2) differences between fields
 3) ensemble mean fields
 4) ensemble std fields

The basic idea is to be able to unify colorbars between
different ensemble members/ensemble statistics between
different research experiments.

Usage:
 1) Get the FA files from ECF -
    configure and run "./get_files.bash"

 2) Setup the epygram module path
    "source setup.bash"

 3) Either create a configuration files in configs/
    or configure your plot options in main_plot.py
    "python3 main_plot.py"

Several example uses are provided in configs-folder.
The output these produce are illustrated in fig/example*.
